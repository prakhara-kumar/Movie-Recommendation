WHAT ARE RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS ?

Well, like I said Netflix, Amazon, Disney Hotstar is a great example, and one I'm very familiar with. So, if you go to their recommendations section, you can see that it will recommend things that you might be interested in purchasing based on your past behavior on the site. The recommender system might include things that you've rated, or things that you bought, and other data as well. But, it's pretty cool. You can also think of the people who bought this also bought feature on Amazon as a form of recommender system.

HOW COSINE SIMILARITY WORKS ?

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
